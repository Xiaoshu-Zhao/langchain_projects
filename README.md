### Intro
This repo is about my learning process of learning Langchain and python. I am following the course of Andrew Ng, LangChain for (LLM Application Development)[https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/langchain-for-llm-application-development/], on Deeplearning.ai, as well as, Langchian offical document.

In detail, it includes:

- read source code of Langchain and made some notes. Please check learning_doc directory
- review python foundation knowledge. Please check python_foundation directory
- hands on projects, from simple to hard.
